# Galaxian Clone

This repository contains a clone of the classic 1979 arcade game **Galaxian**, implemented in **C++** with **SDL** for graphics and input. The project was developed for **CISS 245: Advanced Programming** as an exercise in **pointers**, **object-oriented programming**, and **inheritance**.

The game simulates the original Galaxian mechanics: fleets of alien ships move in formation, dive in attack patterns, and fire at the playerâ€™s starfighter. The player must dodge attacks, fire lasers, destroy enemies, and survive through successive waves.
